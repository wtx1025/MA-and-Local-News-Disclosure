## **Overview**

This repository contains code that produce results in M&A research project, led by Prof. Kim and Prof. Cha. The dataset was fetched from Compustat, CRSP, and Audit Analytics.

The core idea here is that local newspaper closures reduce public information about firms and increase **information asymmetry** between potential targets and potential acquirers. We study how media closures and mergers affects M&A outcome and whether firms with specific characteristics can mitigate the adverse effects brought by information asymmetry.
