## **Overview**

This repository contains code to reproduce results for an M&A research project led by Professors Kim and Cha. The data are accessed via [WRDS](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/) â€” including Compustat, CRSP, and Audit Analytics.

The core premise is that local newspaper closures reduce publicly available firm information and heighten information asymmetry between prospective acquirers and targets. We examine how these closures affect M&A outcomes and whether certain firm characteristics can mitigate the adverse effects of increased information asymmetry.
